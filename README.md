<p>The requirements for this application include the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Take in the value of the bill</li>
  <li>Take in the desired tip percentage</li>
  <li>Include the option to split the bill/tip by the people at the table</li>
  <li>The application should then calculate the amount of tip per table (or per person if the split option is chosen) and return the value to the user.</li>
</ul>
